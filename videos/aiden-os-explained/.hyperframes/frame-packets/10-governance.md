## Frame 10 — Governance

- scene: Type relay on the loop: "build → govern → observe → remediate" with a "policy: passed" chip landing on govern; below, the recommend → approve → act-within-policy ladder.

narrativeRole: The trust beat; answers "we don't trust agents to change production".
keyMessage: Guardrails baked in.

Adapt: keep the pinned anchor with stepping states; the loop line pins, the chip and ladder step beneath it.
Scene 1 (0.0–2.4s): the loop line "build → govern → observe → remediate" reveals center-upper, mono; on "every action inside policy" @0.1 the word "govern" lights accent yellow and the "policy: passed" chip spring-settles onto it (`spring-pop-entrance`).
Scene 2 (2.4–5.2s): on "bounded autonomy that scales…", the three-step ladder builds left to right — recommend → approve → act within policy — each step a hairline card landing in sequence.
Scene 3 (5.2–6.9s): held read; stillness.

## Selected blueprint: fixed-anchor-cycle

# fixed-anchor-cycle — Fixed Anchor, Cycling World

**intent**: One element is PINNED — a wordmark, a composer box, an anchor line that enters once and never moves again — while the adjacent region (or the entire surrounding theme) cycles through many discrete states around it, cadence often manipulated (steady stepping, a fast carousel, or a slow→accelerating flurry), resolving on an emphasis beat into a completed lockup or a muted freeze. The stillness of the anchor IS the claim: everything changes, this stays. Distinct from `kinetic-type-beats` sub-shape A, where a word-slot inside a centered line swaps and the sentence itself is the subject — there the anchor is a sentence frame on a bare type field; here the anchor is the PRODUCT identity and what cycles around it can be non-text (whole theme skins, chrome/logo swaps, textured label chips, a carousel list), the cycle asserts breadth ("everyone says / works everywhere / calling all X"), and the resolve completes the anchor into a lockup. Distinct from `ticker-takeover`, whose cycle ends in a collision — a hero crashes in and shoves the text aside; here nothing ever collides with the anchor: the cycle stops, and a final element quietly joins it.

**roles served**

- Brand_Outro (from `static-anchor-rapid-text-swaps`): when the sign-off is the brand name sitting immovable while praise quotes / tagline words cycle beside or beneath it — steady per-word highlight stepping, or a hard-cut chip flurry that accelerates — landing on the finished lockup ("bolt.new / prompt, run, edit, deploy / enjoy."; "Opus 4.6 by ANTHROP\C").
- Benefits: when "works everywhere" is shown literally — one product surface (a prompt composer with one verbatim string) pinned dead-center while its ENTIRE shell morphs in place through N product themes (background, typography, radii, chrome, logos all crossfading at once), ending in a washed-out freeze.
- Hook: when the opener is a roll-call — a static anchor line holds while an accent-colored line beneath it runs as a fast vertical carousel through an audience/option list, then the block clears into follow-up statement beats that land the brand line.

**duration**: 6.6–11.1s (Benefits shortest ~6.6s at 4 theme beats; Brand_Outro ~9–9.4s; Hook longest ~11s when the anchor-cycle block hands off to follow-up statement beats). The cycle engine itself occupies ~3–5s regardless of role.

**shot structure** (flat static frame — camera locked in every member; a `[bg]` field, solid or subtly drifting; two folded sub-shapes — **(A) adjacent-region cycle**: the anchor holds and a neighboring slot swaps through N states; **(B) whole-context morph**: the anchor holds and everything AROUND it re-skins in place)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~2.0s) — the anchor lands and PINS.** The `[anchor: wordmark / product name / composer box / lead line]` enters once — fade/scale-in centered, word-by-word build, or already present at frame one — at a fixed position it will hold for the entire clip. Zero movement from here on: no drift, no breathe, no re-layout. If the anchor is a UI surface (sub-shape B), it carries a `[verbatim string]` with a blinking cursor.

- **Scene 2 (~2.0s–~70% of runtime) — the cycle engine (signature move).** The world changes around the unmoved anchor. Choose by sub-shape:
  - **Sub-shape A (adjacent-region cycle)**: a region beside/beneath the anchor steps through N discrete states — pick ONE swap mechanic and ONE cadence:
    - _swap mechanics_: instant hard-cut label replacement (a `[chip / tape label]` slaps over the old one, texture/highlight shifting slightly, chip width re-fitting each `[phrase]` — growing away from the anchor, never over it); sequential per-word highlight stepping (one word of the `[tagline]` snaps bright/bold while the rest sits dim grey, the highlight walking the line); or a fast vertical carousel (each `[list item]` slide/fades through the accent slot ~0.5s/phrase).
    - _cadences_: steady stepping (~0.5–1s/state), or **slow→accelerating flurry** — ~1s beats compressing to ~0.15–0.3s per swap, breadth escalating into a blur of states (12–16 states read as "everyone"; 3–8 read as a roll-call).
    - Geometry law: the cycling region NEVER overlaps, touches, or displaces the anchor; size the layout so the longest state still fits inside the frame with clear margins.
  - **Sub-shape B (whole-context morph)**: at ~1.3s intervals the entire theme — `[bg color]`, typography, corner radii, toolbar icons, footer `[brand logos]`, contextual lines — morphs in place via quick (~0.3s) crossfades through N `[product skins]`, every property blending simultaneously. No hard cuts, no wipes; the anchor's content string is identical in every skin (chrome details like a `> ` prefix may adapt per skin).

- **Scene 3 (~70–85%) — the emphasis beat.** The cycle resolves — it does not just stop:
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (highlight stepping)_: the whole `[tagline]` snaps solid bright at once — full-line illumination after the per-word walk.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (flurry)_: the flurry halts and HOLDS on the `[longest / weightiest phrase]` — a beat of stillness after acceleration.
  - _Variant — Benefits (theme morph)_: the final beat mutes — a faint `[dot-grid]` fades in across the background while the UI drops to low opacity, a washed-out blueprint freeze.
  - _Variant — Hook (carousel)_: the anchor block clears, handing off to 1–3 centered word-by-word statement beats (kinetic-type-beats territory) that carry toward the close.

- **Scene 4 (final beat → end) — lockup completion and HOLD.** A final element joins the still-unmoved anchor and the finished composition holds static to the end: a `[closing word]` drops in below, aligned to the last cycled state ("enjoy."); the chip vanishes on a hard cut and the `[brand sign-off]` appears beside the anchor on a shared baseline ("by ANTHROP\C"); or the final `[brand line]` builds word-by-word dead-center and holds ("with Copilot."). Long static hold — the lockup is the payoff, give it 20–30% of the runtime.

**motion vocabulary**: anchor fade/scale-in entrance; permanently pinned anchor (zero movement, no idle breathe); instant hard-cut label/chip replacement (slap-over with subtle texture/highlight shift); chip width resize-to-fit per phrase (grows away from the anchor); sequential per-word highlight stepping through a line; dim-to-grey line state; whole-line illumination snap; fast vertical carousel slide/fade of one line under a static line; cadence acceleration (slow ~1s beats into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry); hold-on-longest-phrase emphasis beat; in-place theme morph crossfade (~0.3s) blending background/fonts/radii/icons simultaneously; per-beat chrome/logo swap; blinking text cursor; contextual line appearing/disappearing across beats; dot-grid backdrop fade-in; global opacity washout; end freeze; word-by-word phrase build; block clear between scenes; drop-in entrance of a final word; hard cut to final lockup; long static hold.

**rule mapping**

- instant hard-cut chip/label/phrase swaps at time thresholds; per-word highlight stepping (color/weight state swaps); dim-line → full-line illumination snap; per-state chip width set (a per-state layout property, set discretely — never tweened) → `discrete-text-sequence`
- fast vertical carousel of the accent line under the static anchor (slide/fade stepped swaps in a masked slot) → `vertical-spring-ticker` (its footer-reveal step unused — Scene 4's lockup takes its place)
- per-phrase state windows computed from a script of N states (praise quotes, audience list, theme beats) → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (Accelerating cadence — for the flurry, pre-compute the beat array with shrinking `hold` values, geometric decay over the state list)
- word-by-word phrase builds (anchor line, follow-up statements, final brand line) → `dynamic-content-sequencing` + `waterfall-entry` (or `kinetic-beat-slam` when the statements should land percussively)
- anchor entrance fade/scale-in; drop-in of the final closing word → `spring-pop-entrance` (restrained overshoot — the register here is editorial, not bouncy)
- blinking cursor in the pinned composer → `context-sensitive-cursor` (color adapts per theme skin at segment boundaries)
- whole-context theme morph → `theme-crossfade-morph` (N pre-styled full-scene layers stacked at the same geometry, opacity-crossfaded, the shared anchor string rendered once on top); the composer shell's radius/surface component alone → `card-morph-anchor`
- subtly drifting background field beneath the cycle → `sine-wave-loop` (bounded drift; the anchor itself gets none)
- dot-grid fade-in + global opacity washout freeze; long static hold → `gsap-effects` (plain opacity tweens) / static hold (no rule needed)

**camera modifier**: none — every member is fully camera-static; the cycle is the only motion, and the pinned anchor's stillness is load-bearing. Do not add a push-in "for energy"; it would break the anchor contract.

## Selected motion rule: spring-pop-entrance

name: spring-pop-entrance
description: The canonical entrance pop — an element (or staggered group) arrives by scaling 0 → 1 on a smooth long-tail settle (power3 default); bouncy overshoot is a rare, explicitly-playful exception. fromTo so it's correct at t=0 under seek.

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

## Values

| token      | range                                     | notes                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EASE       | `power3.out` default; `expo.out` punchier | `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` only in the playful variant                |
| POP_DUR    | 0.4–0.7s                                  | shorter = tight snap; hero must be visible by **t ≤ 0.5s**       |
| STAGGER    | 0.04–0.08s                                | `min(0.06, 0.5 / ITEM_COUNT)` — self-caps the window             |
| ITEM_COUNT | 3–9                                       | >9 makes the stagger vanish — switch to a wipe/sweep reveal      |
| Y_RISE     | 0–32px                                    | small; never large enough to read as a slide-up                  |
| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.
