## Selected blueprint: dataviz-countup

# dataviz-countup — Data-Viz / Count-Up

**intent**: Make numbers and charts the hero — a count-up ring/number, a trend chart, a tilted stat/card grid — and traverse the data instruments with a camera that pushes THROUGH them (or scrolls across them) to land on one hero metric, so the data itself carries the argument.

**roles served**

- Problem (from `problem-dataviz-pushthrough`): quantifies the pain with real-looking instruments — a count-up ring → a trend chart → a stat grid — the camera pushing THROUGH each object into the next to dramatize a worsening / large-scale problem ("X% of people struggle with…").
- Product_Intro (from `product-intro-dataviz-scroll-reveal`): a confident "look at the result / the data" open — hard-cut from a hook word into a perspective-tilted grid of data-viz cards, then a hands-off camera scroll lands one glowing hero metric while a kinetic tagline assembles word-by-word.
- Hook (from `hook-counter-burst`): a cold-open hook on ONE dramatic statistic — the frame opens dark and empty, 3–5 thematic icons puncture in clustered at center, then the headline number EXPLODES upward in size as the icons fling outward to their marks (the count-up and the spread are one beat), closed by a slow camera lean-in. Kinetic from frame 1.
- Key_Feature (from dark-stat-scrub-montage): prove the feature with its own analytics — on a black canvas, kinetic headline beats alternate with self-drawing charts and a 3D-tilted dark dashboard that a cursor SCRUBS (tracking line + live tooltips), stitched by hard cuts and one zoom punch. The one variant where a cursor touches the data.
- Social_Proof (from `gauge-beat`): a single count-up instrument — radial gauge arc-draw + rapidly ticking metric + caption — embedded as ONE BEAT inside a kinetic-typography relay; entered and exited by element-level scale/blur push-throughs on a static frame. The instrument guest-stars; the relay itself belongs to kinetic-type-beats.

**duration**: ~4–12s (Hook ~4s · Product_Intro ~6s · dark-scrub-montage ~7.3–7.75s · Problem ~11–12s · gauge-beat ~2.5s inside a ~10.8s relay)

**shot structure** Data-viz field on `[bg color]` (dark or light, soft corner glows); `[gradient A→B]` brand stroke on charts/rings; clean sans-serif white/dark text; a continuous camera move runs underneath that traverses 2–3 data instruments and resolves on a hero metric. One instrument per beat; the camera carries the cut.

- Scene 1 (0.0–Xs): the first data instrument establishes centered — a `[stat]` reads as the hero. A bold center number COUNTS UP `[start]`→`[end]` while its transform scale grows to the static final type size, with `[stat label]` below; its paired graphic (a circular progress RING sweeping to `[pct]` with a `[gradient]` stroke, or a bar/fill) animates in on the SAME ease so number + graphic land as one beat. Supporting `[avatar/object]` elements pop in with spring overshoot into a scattered glowing orbit; a `[headline]` fades up. A very slow continuous camera zoom-in runs throughout.
- Scene 2 (Xs–Ys): the camera traverses to the next instrument and that instrument animates — a `[gradient]` trend line / area chart DRAWS left→right on grid lines (Problem), or off-center cards SCROLL away as the layout glides (Product_Intro). The arriving `[stat-2]` number counts up / the chart resolves.
- Scene 3 / Scene N (…–end): the camera lands the `[hero metric card]` (big number + label + delta + rising chart) in dead-center; a soft `[accent]` glow blooms behind it; the move reaches its peak then eases to a settled, slightly wider composition with the hero centered and supporting cards flanking it. HOLD on the final frame.

- Variant — Problem (push-THROUGH, count-up → trend → grid): Scene 1 is a centered circular progress ring + count-up center number with scattered glowing `[avatar/object]` orbit. Scene 2 is a fast camera PUSH-IN straight through the center of the ring (ring, number, orbiting elements scale up and fly out of frame) into a rounded `[card]` holding `[stat-2 header]` over a `[gradient]` line chart with grid lines + translucent area fill that draws left→right; camera pushes through then settles. Scene 3: camera PANS to a second `[card]` whose number counts up, holding a grid of the `[avatar/object]` elements — a subset dim/blur while the rest receive `[accent]` circular checkmark badges that SPRING-POP; camera settles to the end. The traversal is z-depth push-through between instruments.
- Variant — Product_Intro (scroll-to-hero + word-by-word tagline): a brief opener — Scene 0 (~0.0–0.85s): a full-frame `[hero-color orb]` with a bold white `[hook phrase]` over it; static shimmer, then HARD CUT. Scene 1 cuts to a slightly perspective-TILTED grid of `[data-viz / product cards]` (charts, heatmaps, stat cards with deltas + source footers) with `[tagline word 1]` centered; the grid begins SCROLLING (e.g. toward upper-left) with its tilt held. Scene 2: the grid keeps scrolling so the `[hero metric card]` glides into dead-center as off-center cards slide away; `[tagline word 1]` translates out and `[word 2]` rises in from a frame edge. Scene 3: hero card settles centered, `[accent]` glow blooms behind it, camera PUSHES IN slightly; `[word 2]` holds near it. Scene 4: `[word 2]` slides out, the final `[tagline word]` drops in from the opposite edge above the still-glowing hero, push-in peaks. Scene 5: overlay type clears, camera eases BACK OUT to a settled wider tilted composition — hero centered with glow, supporting cards flanking. The traversal is a hands-off camera SCROLL across a tilted card plane (no cursor, no clicks) + a one-word-at-a-time kinetic headline + push-in-then-out bookend.
- Variant — Key_Feature (dark-scrub-montage: kinetic beats × instruments, cut-stitched): on black, `[kinetic word]` beats ALTERNATE with data instruments; hard cuts stitch the beats and the camera is locked per beat — the traversal is a montage, not a continuous move. Beat A: a bold `[heading]` holds while a thick `[trend line]` DRAWS itself left→right inside a dark chart band, rising to break above the band's edge; at the peak a `[accent]` dot pops and a pill tooltip springs in, its label building to `[value + delta]`. Beat B: ONE fast zoom PUNCH lands a close-up, slightly 3D-tilted dark `[analytics dashboard]` (metric cards with deltas, translucent oversized numerals floating behind); a white cursor SCRUBS a chart — a vertical tracking line follows it and `[date: value]` tooltips read out live, then a second chart ACTIVATES with a color flip and its own scrubbing tooltip — while the tilted plane drifts gently sideways; quick pull-away/fade to black. Beat C: a `[glowing wave / typed line / impact word]` beat lands the closing stat LOCKUP — `[title]` + big `[stat]` counting up + `[green delta arrow + context line]` — and holds static to the end. Kinetic words between instruments scale up violently past the frame as element-level push-through transitions (no camera).
- Variant — Social_Proof (gauge-beat inside a relay): a static-camera kinetic-type relay hosts ONE instrument beat — thin concentric `[accent]` arcs radiate from center, a thick `[accent]` progress arc draws clockwise over them, a large `[metric]` rapidly ticks up to `[big value]` with a `[caption]` below; the group slowly scales up (element-level drift), then hard-cuts out to the next text beat. Entry/exit for every beat is scale-up-from-blur in / scale-up-and-blur-past-frame out — a fake push-through with no camera anywhere. Use when social proof is one number and the surrounding beats are typography.

**motion vocabulary** count-up number with transform-scale growth on the value; circular progress-ring sweep; growth bar / progress fill; gradient trend-line + area-fill left→right draw; spring-overshoot pop-in of scattered glowing avatar/object elements; perspective-tilted card grid; directional grid scroll (cards glide in/out of center); hero-card centering; soft accent glow bloom behind the hero; slow continuous zoom-in; fast camera push-IN / push-THROUGH the center of an instrument; lateral/vertical camera pan between cards; gentle push-in that peaks then eases back out to a wider settle; selective dim/blur of a subset + spring-pop checkmark badges; full-frame hook orb → hard cut; kinetic tagline assembled word-by-word (each word drops/rises from a frame edge, prior word slides out). Dark-scrub-montage additions: self-drawing chart line that breaks above its band; peak dot + pill tooltip spring-pop; cursor chart scrub with vertical tracking line + live date/value tooltip readouts; chart activation color flip; 3D-tilted dark dashboard plane with slow lateral drift; translucent oversized numerals floating behind cards; fast zoom punch-in; pull-away/fade-to-black beat exit; hard-cut beat stitching; kinetic word push-through (element scales up past the frame); typed line with blinking cursor; impact slam word + particle-dissolve punctuation; glowing wave draw; green delta arrow pop; stat lockup hold. Gauge-beat additions: concentric static arcs + thick clockwise progress-arc draw; rapid count-up tick; scale-up-from-blur entrance / scale-up-and-blur-past-frame exit (element-level fake push-through).

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- count-up number whose transform scale grows with the value → `counting-dynamic-scale` (primary text rule)
- circular progress-ring sweep (the ring fill) → `stat-bars-and-fills` (ring form) — its draw mechanics delegate to → `svg-path-draw`
- growth bars / progress fill paired beside a number → `stat-bars-and-fills` (primary data rule)
- gradient trend-line / area-chart left→right draw → `svg-path-draw` (a path/line draws itself)
- spring-overshoot pop-in of the avatar/object elements → `spring-pop-entrance` (elastic overshoot); the scattered-ring layout of glowing avatars/objects → `avatar-cloud-network`; if they keep drifting/orbiting → `orbit-3d-entry`
- spring-pop `[accent]` checkmark badges → `spring-pop-entrance`
- perspective-tilted card grid (tilt held static while content moves) → `3d-page-scroll`
- directional scroll across the tilted card plane (cards glide in/out of center) → `3d-page-scroll` (scroll) + `viewport-change` (lateral/vertical pan form)
- hero metric card centering (scroll/pan lands the target dead-center) → `coordinate-target-zoom` (target lands at viewport center) / `viewport-change`
- hard-cut from the hook orb into the grid → `scale-swap-transition`
- kinetic tagline assembled word-by-word → `kinetic-beat-slam` (one onset grid, distinct per-word entrances)
- slow continuous zoom-in + push-THROUGH the instruments + lateral/vertical pan between cards + push-in-then-out bookend → `multi-phase-camera` (see camera modifier)
- soft accent glow BLOOM behind the hero card → `ambient-glow-bloom` (un-triggered soft glow/bloom behind the static hero element — distinct from `press-release-spring`'s press-triggered glow and `asr-keyword-glow`'s word-timed envelope)
- selective dim/blur of a SUBSET of grid items (focus-falloff on the non-highlighted cards) → `depth-of-field-blur` (selective per-element blur/dim to spotlight the highlighted cards — the same focus-falloff rule used in `constellation-hub`)
- cursor chart scrub (cursor-tied vertical tracking line + live data readout in a tooltip) → `chart-scrub-readout` (the tracking line, tooltip pop, and seek-safe live value readout driven by cursor x)
- chart activation color flip (second chart lights up under the scrub) → `gsap-effects` (color/opacity chord at the scrub handoff — basic tween, no dedicated rule needed)
- 3D-tilted dashboard plane + slow lateral drift → `3d-page-scroll` (the tilt framing) + `sine-wave-loop` (the drift; keep amplitude tiny so the scrub stays legible)
- fast zoom punch-in to the dashboard → `multi-phase-camera` (one short aggressive push phase) aimed via `coordinate-target-zoom`; add `motion-blur-streak` at peak velocity
- kinetic word push-through / scale-up-and-blur-past-frame exit / scale-up-from-blur entrance → `kinetic-beat-slam` (the beat grammar) + `motion-blur-streak` (blur peaks at max speed, resolves at the settle — its entrance form runs the blur-in, its exit form the blow-past)
- typed line with blinking cursor → `discrete-text-sequence` + `context-sensitive-cursor` (square-wave blink)
- impact slam word → `kinetic-beat-slam`; its particle-dissolve punctuation → `particle-burst` (glyph→particles dissolve, deterministic)
- glowing wave draw → `svg-path-draw` (the draw) + `ambient-glow-bloom` (the glow envelope)
- green delta arrow pop / peak dot + pill tooltip → `spring-pop-entrance`
- concentric static arcs + clockwise progress-arc draw (gauge beat) → `stat-bars-and-fills` (ring form) → draw mechanics `svg-path-draw` (both already mapped above — the gauge is the existing ring with static concentric chrome behind it)

**camera modifier**: The camera is the through-line that traverses the data instruments — one camera wrapper sequenced by `multi-phase-camera`, with each stop targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` onto the focal instrument/card.

- Problem — push-THROUGH: a slow continuous zoom-in (drift overlay) plus a fast PUSH-IN straight through the center of one instrument into the next (`multi-phase-camera`, Steady-push pattern), then a lateral/vertical PAN to the final card. Z-depth push-through is the signature (distinguishes it from a flat pan-tour).
- Product_Intro — scroll-to-hero + bookend push: a hands-off directional SCROLL across the tilted card plane (`3d-page-scroll` scroll / `viewport-change` pan) that lands the hero card center, then a gentle push-in that PEAKS and eases BACK OUT to a wider settle (`multi-phase-camera`, Bookend-pull pattern). No cursor, no clicks — the camera does the navigating.
- Key_Feature — montage-cut: the camera is NOT the through-line — hard cuts stitch the instrument beats, the frame is locked inside each beat, and exactly ONE fast zoom punch (`multi-phase-camera` single push phase + `coordinate-target-zoom`) lands the dashboard close-up; exits are pull-away/fade-to-black. Between instruments, ELEMENTS fake the push: kinetic words scale up past the frame (`kinetic-beat-slam` + `motion-blur-streak`). Gauge-beat form drops even the punch — fully static, all push-through element-level. Reach for this mode when the dialect is a dark rapid montage; the Problem/Product_Intro modes remain the default for a single continuous argument.

# Chart Scrub Readout

The chart is already ON screen — this rule **interrogates** it. A vertical tracking line rides the scrub position, a marker dot follows the series, and a live tooltip reads out `date: value` per position, values flickering past like an odometer. It's the "this data is real — look closer" beat: the scrub proves the chart is an instrument, not a picture.

Boundary with its neighbors: [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md) owns the chart's ARRIVAL; [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md) owns a single number swelling in place. This rule assumes the graphic already exists and adds a **read head** moving across it. The three chain naturally: the line draws in (svg-path-draw / stat-bars), this rule scrubs it, and the landing value hands off to a count-up lockup.

## How It Works

1. **Data baked at setup** — a literal `DATA` array of `{ d, v }` points (or a pure index formula). The polyline's `points` attribute is computed ONCE from `DATA` by pure mapping functions: chart and readout share one source of truth. The argument of the shot is "this data is real" — a random walk regenerated per render breaks both determinism and the rhetorical claim.
2. **One driver tween** `p: 0 → 1` derives everything in its `onUpdate`: tracking-line x, marker x/y, tooltip position. Every output is a pure function of `p` — any seek lands the identical frame. Parallel tweens that merely share timing drift apart under rounding and read as chart chrome, not a read head.
3. **The marker rides the polyline** — its y interpolates between the two neighboring baked points, from the same arrays that built the chart; a separately-keyframed marker inevitably floats off the line.
4. **The readout is threshold-stepped** — the nearest data index derives from `p`, and `textContent` is written ONLY when that index changes (last-index guard). Transforms glide per frame (compositor-cheap); text steps per data point — no per-frame DOM text thrash. The guard is an optimization, not state: any seek recomputes the same index and the same text.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip. Size the SVG so viewBox units === CSS pixels:
     one coordinate space serves the polyline, tracking line, marker, AND the HTML tooltip. -->
<div class="chart-wrap">
  <!-- position: relative — the tooltip transforms against this box -->
  <svg class="chart" viewBox="0 0 CHART_W CHART_H" width="CHART_W" height="CHART_H">
    <polyline id="series-a" class="series" fill="none" />
    <line id="track-line" y1="0" y2="CHART_H" stroke-dasharray="6 6" />
    <circle id="marker" r="MARKER_R" />
  </svg>
  <div class="tooltip" id="tooltip">
    <span id="tip-date">{firstDate}</span>
    <span id="tip-value">{firstValue}</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.tooltip {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  min-width: TIP_MIN_WIDTH; /* fixed — the box must not resize as values change length */
}
#tip-value {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits flicker past; widths must not */
}
```

```js
// Data baked at setup — literal values.
const DATA = [
  { d: "{date1}", v: V1 },
  // ... N points, chronological ...
];

// Pure mapping functions — geometry derives from DATA once.
const PAD = CHART_PAD;
const PLOT_W = CHART_W - PAD * 2;
const PLOT_H = CHART_H - PAD * 2;
const vals = DATA.map((p) => p.v);
const V_MIN = Math.min(...vals);
const V_MAX = Math.max(...vals);
const X = (i) => PAD + (i / (DATA.length - 1)) * PLOT_W;
const Y = (v) => PAD + PLOT_H * (1 - (v - V_MIN) / (V_MAX - V_MIN));

document
  .getElementById("series-a")
  .setAttribute("points", DATA.map((p, i) => `${X(i)},${Y(p.v)}`).join(" "));

const line = document.getElementById("track-line");
const marker = document.getElementById("marker");
const tooltip = document.getElementById("tooltip");
const tipDate = document.getElementById("tip-date");
const tipValue = document.getElementById("tip-value");

// Tooltip pops in as the scrub begins — a small fromTo scale/opacity spring at SCRUB_AT.

// ONE driver — line, marker, and tooltip are all projections of p.
const scrub = { p: 0 };
let lastIdx = -1;
tl.to(
  scrub,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: SCRUB_DUR,
    ease: SCRUB_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      const f = scrub.p * (DATA.length - 1); // fractional index
      const i = Math.min(DATA.length - 2, Math.floor(f));
      const t = f - i;
      const x = X(i) + (X(i + 1) - X(i)) * t;
      const y = Y(DATA[i].v) + (Y(DATA[i + 1].v) - Y(DATA[i].v)) * t;

      // Transforms glide every frame (cheap, deterministic)
      line.setAttribute("x1", x);
      line.setAttribute("x2", x);
      marker.setAttribute("cx", x);
      marker.setAttribute("cy", y);
      tooltip.style.transform = `translate(${x + TIP_DX}px, ${y - TIP_DY}px)`;

      // Text steps only when the nearest data point changes
      const idx = Math.round(f);
      if (idx !== lastIdx) {
        tipDate.textContent = DATA[idx].d;
        tipValue.textContent = `${DATA[idx].v.toLocaleString()} {unitLabel}`;
        lastIdx = idx;
      }
    },
  },
  SCRUB_AT,
);
// End hold: the driver finishes before the scene does — the landed value reads.
```

## Variations

- **Peak stop** — the scrub is the wind-up, the landing is the stat: `SCRUB_EASE: "power3.out"` decelerates onto the final/peak point, then pop the emphasis at landing (`fromTo` marker `scale: 1 → PEAK_POP_SCALE` at `SCRUB_AT + SCRUB_DUR`). Pair with a pill tooltip that springs to its final label ([spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md)) — the classic "line breaks above the band" climax.
- **Second-series activation on cross** — series B sits dimmed; at `SCRUB_AT + SCRUB_DUR * CROSS_P` tween its stroke to the lit color (0.25s, `power2.out`), and in the driver's `onUpdate` read from B's array once `scrub.p ≥ CROSS_P` (still index-guarded). The color flip lands ON the cross — same-frame causality.
- **Two-chart glide** — two scrub beats: sweep chart A, glide the cursor/tooltip group across the gutter (a plain `x` tween, no readout — dead travel, not data), then chart B activates with its own driver. One driver per chart.
- **Cursor-led scrub** — an oversized cursor is the visible actor: another projection of the SAME driver (positioned from `x` in the same `onUpdate`, tip at the tracking line's head) — never a second tween that merely matches timing. Cursor look and click grammar from [cursor-click-ripple.md](cursor-click-ripple.md).
- **Playhead form** — no cursor; the tracking line IS the actor (timeline scrubbers, audio waves, session replays). `ease: "none"` — mechanical playback, not a hand.

## Critical Constraints

- **`DATA` is literal at setup**; polyline points derive from it via pure functions — chart and readout share one source of truth.
- **Seed at setup** — call the scrub applier once with `p = 0` right after building (à la `3d-camera-flight`'s `applyCamera()`), or a seek to t=0 before the driver runs shows the tracking line/marker at their HTML-default positions.
- **Single driver** — one `p` tween; all scrub outputs (line, marker, tooltip, any cursor) computed in its `onUpdate`, each a pure function of `p`.
- **Readout writes guarded by index change** — `onUpdate` stays O(1): a few attribute sets, one transform, text only on step.
- **SVG `viewBox` units = CSS pixels** (`viewBox="0 0 W H"` with matching `width`/`height`) — one coordinate space must serve the SVG internals and the HTML tooltip's transform.
- **`tabular-nums` + fixed `min-width`** on the tooltip value.
- **The chart pre-exists** — draw-in belongs to `svg-path-draw` / `stat-bars-and-fills`; sequence it BEFORE the scrub, don't blend them.
- **Land the read** — hold the final value ≥0.8s (or hand off to a count-up lockup).

# Theme Crossfade Morph

The whole world re-skins while one thing holds still. A composer box cycles through four IDE themes; a checkout widget flips through brand skins — background, typography, corner radii, toolbar icons, footer logos all change **at once**, in place, in ~0.3s, N times — and through every flip one anchor element (the prompt string, the widget layout, the wordmark) **never moves**. The anchor's stillness is the rhetorical claim: _everything changes, this doesn't._

Boundary: [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) morphs **one container** between two shots — its dimensions, radius, and surface tween continuously. This rule re-skins an **entire scene** through **N discrete states**: nothing tweens property-by-property (fonts, icons, and logos can't interpolate); the "morph" is a fast simultaneous crossfade of complete pre-styled layers. ([scale-swap-transition.md](scale-swap-transition.md) swaps an element at center; here the surroundings swap and the element holds.)

## How It Works

1. **One skin = one complete layer.** Each theme state is a fully pre-styled, full-bleed layer (`position: absolute; inset: 0`) containing everything that changes: background, shell/chrome, toolbar icons, footer logos, typography. All `N_SKINS` layers exist in the DOM from `t=0`, stacked; skin 0 starts visible, the rest at `opacity: 0`.
2. **The morph is a crossfade.** At each boundary, two opposing opacity tweens run at the same timeline position over `MORPH_DUR` (~0.3s): outgoing `1 → 0`, incoming `0 → 1`. Because both layers are complete, every property "blends" simultaneously for free — including the un-tweenable ones (font families, icon glyphs, logos), which read as morphing precisely because everything else is mid-blend around them.
3. **The anchor renders once, on top.** The element that must not move lives in its own layer above all skins and is **excluded from every skin layer**. No transforms, no re-parenting, no per-skin restyle.
4. **Windows are precomputed.** `T_k = CYCLE_START + k × (SKIN_HOLD + MORPH_DUR)`. Steady cadence by default; hold the final skin longest when it's the resolve.

The only animated property is `opacity` — which is why this rule is seek-safe with zero special machinery.

  const at = CYCLE_START + k * (SKIN_HOLD + MORPH_DUR);
  tl.fromTo(skin, { opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR, ease: "power2.inOut" }, at);

// The anchor gets NO tweens. Its absence from the timeline is the point.
```

## Variations

- **Anchor-typography reskin (per-layer copies)** — when the anchor's own type treatment must change with the theme (mono in the terminal skin, sans in the editor skin), each skin carries its own copy of the anchor at **pixel-identical geometry** and there is no separate top layer; the invariant shifts from "one element" to "one geometry." Verify the copies overlay exactly (screenshot two skins at 50% opacity) — a 2px baseline drift reads as the anchor flinching, which breaks the whole claim.
- **Skin-cycle tour with logo relay** — a large brand logo outside the anchored shell crossfades **in the same windows** as the skins (logo k with skin k, same `MORPH_DUR`). The paired swap sells "same product, every brand."
- **Washout finale** — after the last skin, a final low-key layer (faint dot-grid, blueprint wash) fades in while the last shell drops to ~0.25 opacity — the cycle resolves into a held diagram of itself. One extra window; the anchor may fade with the shell or hold full-strength.
- **Emphasis brake** — steady cadence for `N−1` skins, then hold the final skin 2–3× `SKIN_HOLD`; the cycle demonstrates breadth, the brake lands the resolve. Precompute the hold array; don't drift the cadence without cause.

## Critical Constraints

- **The anchor never moves.** No transforms, no opacity dips, no re-parenting, no restyle — the contrast between total churn and total stillness is the entire device; one flinch and the shot becomes a slideshow.
- **Nothing tweens but `opacity`** — no `borderRadius` / `background` tweens; radii and colors change by being different in the next layer. Visibility via `opacity` only, never `display` / `visibility` toggles (they can't blend mid-fade).
- **Pixel-align the shared geometry** — mid-blend both skins are partially visible; aligned shells read as one UI changing clothes, misaligned shells ghost into two UIs.
- **Pre-style everything** — each skin is complete and static; no class toggling, no runtime restyle mid-tween.
- **Outgoing and incoming tweens share one timeline position** — a staggered blend flashes the stage background between skins.
- **Adjacent windows only** — skin k crossfades with k+1, never k+2; at no frame are three skins partially visible.
- **Camera static — always.** A push-in on top of a theme cycle destroys the stillness that makes the anchor read.
- **Hard cuts are the cheaper sibling** — if the states should _snap_, that's `discrete-text-sequence` territory; the ~0.3s blend is specifically the "morph" read.

# Ambient Glow Bloom

A soft radial glow that **blooms in behind a hero element** (card, logo, metric) and holds, giving it presence. Unlike `press-release-spring`'s click-triggered burst or `asr-keyword-glow`'s word-timed envelope, this glow is **un-triggered** — it blooms on the hero's settle and stays lit. Two forms: a **hero bloom** that swells behind a settling element then breathes, and a **traveling sweep** that translates a soft highlight across a surface exactly once.

## How It Works

A radial-gradient layer sits **behind** the hero (glow `z-index: 1`, hero `z-index: 2` — a glow in front occludes it), starting at `opacity: 0`. Over the bloom-in window it ramps `opacity: 0 → peak` with a gentle `scale` swell, timed so `BLOOM_START + BLOOM_DUR` lands on the hero's settle — glow and hero resolve as ONE beat ("powering on"), never glow-then-card. After bloom-in:

1. **Hero bloom** — a **bounded idle breathe** during the hold: a finite `ease: "none"` tween advances a `phase` proxy and `onUpdate` nudges opacity + scale a hair around peak (never a `yoyo` loop). `sin(0) = 0` → the breathe starts exactly at the bloom's resting state.
2. **Traveling sweep** — a narrow highlight band at one edge translates **once** across to the other (`x` off-surface to off-surface), clipped to the surface (`overflow: hidden`). One pass, no return — a repeating sweep reads as a loading shimmer, not a reveal accent (the shimmer-sweep variation below is the sanctioned exception).

Peak opacity stays restrained (**≤ 0.45 hard ceiling**) so the glow gives presence without washing the frame; the glow color is **darker + more saturated** than the element it backs (a same-hue, same-lightness glow disappears into the surface).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<div class="bloom-stage">
  <div class="bloom-glow" id="bloom-glow"></div>
  <!-- z-index: 1; inset: GLOW_INSET (negative); background: {glowGradient} -->
  <div class="hero-card" id="hero-card">{HeroLabel}</div>
  <!-- z-index: 2 -->
</div>
<!-- sweep form: <div class="sweep" id="sweep"> inside the overflow:hidden surface -->
```

```js
// ── Form A: HERO BLOOM ── bloom in soft, landing on the hero's settle.
tl.fromTo(
  "#bloom-glow",
  { opacity: 0, scale: GLOW_START_SCALE },
  { opacity: GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY, scale: 1, duration: BLOOM_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  BLOOM_START,
);
// Bounded breathe during the hold — finite phase tween, NOT a yoyo loop.
const glow = document.getElementById("bloom-glow");
const phase = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  phase,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BREATHE_CYCLES,
    duration: BREATHE_DUR,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = Math.sin(phase.p);
      glow.style.opacity = String(GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY + s * OPACITY_AMP);
      glow.style.transform = `scale(${1 + s * SCALE_AMP})`;
    },
  },
  BLOOM_START + BLOOM_DUR,
);

// ── Form B: TRAVELING SWEEP ── one finite pass, constant glide.
tl.fromTo(
  "#sweep",
  { x: SWEEP_START_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: SWEEP_END_X, opacity: SWEEP_PEAK_OPACITY, duration: SWEEP_DUR, ease: "none" },
  SWEEP_START,
);
tl.to("#sweep", { opacity: 0, duration: SWEEP_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.in" }, SWEEP_FADE_START);
```

## Variations

- **Bloom-and-hold** — for scenes <3s or a hero with its own idle, skip the breathe: the single `fromTo` is the whole recipe.
- **Pulse-on-arrival** — bloom slightly PAST peak (`GLOW_OVERSHOOT_OPACITY`, `scale: 1.06`), then a second adjacent tween eases down to a steady hold — one breath punctuating the landing, no ongoing loop.
- **Multi-hero relay** — stagger per-glow `BLOOM_START` by ~0.15–0.3s across a row; shrink `OPACITY_AMP` / `SCALE_AMP` per the `/√N` rule below.
- **Diagonal raked sweep** — angle `{sweepGradient}` (~105°) across a wordmark: the classic one-pass logo sheen. Narrower `SWEEP_WIDTH`, higher `SWEEP_PEAK_OPACITY`.

### Shimmer sweep (text-clipped status-phrase working-state)

The sweep re-aimed **inside type**: a soft highlight gradient clipped into a status phrase ("Thinking…", "Analyzing dataset…") via `background-clip: text` travels left→right through the letterforms — the grey-on-grey shimmer that says _still working_. Unlike every other form here it legitimately **repeats while the status is live**: the repetition is diegetic working-state, not idle wobble (same defense as a blinking caret — the motion performs status). Two things keep it honest: it is **bounded** (one finite tween whose pass count is computed from the status window, never `repeat: -1`), and it is **killed at resolve** — the moment the status completes, the shimmer stops dead; a shimmer surviving into the answer beat turns a working indicator into decoration.

```js
// Status shimmer — N passes as ONE bounded tween. Killed at resolve.
const status = document.getElementById("status-phrase");
// CSS on #status-phrase: background: {shimmerGradient}; background-size: 300% 100%;
// -webkit-background-clip: text; background-clip: text; color: transparent;
const shimmer = { p: 0 };
const PASSES = Math.round(STATUS_DUR / PASS_PERIOD); // whole passes, computed up front
tl.to(
  shimmer,
  {
    p: PASSES,
    duration: STATUS_DUR,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const t = shimmer.p % 1; // 0→1 within each pass; percent axis inverted → left→right travel
      status.style.backgroundPosition = `${(1 - t) * 100}% 50%`;
    },
  },
  STATUS_START,
);
tl.set(status, { backgroundPosition: "100% 50%" }, STATUS_START + STATUS_DUR); // resolve: dead.
```

Keep it a whisper: `{shimmerGradient}` is the status text's own grey with one slightly-lighter band (highlight stop a step above the base, nothing near white); `background-size` ~300% keeps the band narrow in the glyphs; `PASS_PERIOD` 1.2–1.8s — slower reads as a sheen accent, faster as a spinner. Whole-number `PASSES` lands the band at its start position exactly at the kill frame, so the `tl.set` is visually a no-op. This is the working-state cousin of `gradient-text-sweep`: reach **here** when the sweep _means_ "in progress," **there** when the gradient is the typographic treatment itself.

## Critical Constraints

- **Glow peak opacity ≤ 0.45** — including breathe amplitude; default to the LOW end (0.15–0.30).
- **Glow behind, hero in front**; glow color darker + more saturated than the hero surface.
- **Land glow and hero as one beat** — before or after reads as two separate events.
- **Breathe is bounded, sweep is one pass** — the only sanctioned repetition is the shimmer sweep, bounded and killed at resolve.
- **Concurrent halos compound** — per-glow amps ≤ default `/√N`, stagger breathe periods (2.6s / 2.9s / 3.3s) so they don't pulse in lockstep.
- **Don't combine a `boxShadow` glow on the hero with this halo layer** — they compete and read muddy; the glow lives on the dedicated layer.
