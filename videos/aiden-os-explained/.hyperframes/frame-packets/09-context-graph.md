## Frame 9 — The Context Graph

- scene: Kinetic diagram beat: four persona word-chips orbit and connect into one hub labeled "Operational Context Graph"; sub-line: topology, change attribution, drift history, incident causality.
- voiceover: "All four share one Operational Context Graph. What one domain learns, every domain acts on."
- duration: 8.6s
- transition_in: zoom-through
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/09-context-graph.html

- persuasion: Mechanism reveal
- beat: awe
- blueprint: constellation-hub (Adapt)
- focal: the violet hub ring
- roles: hub = cutout · chips = supporting · sub-line = supporting
- sfx: none

narrativeRole: The mechanism that separates a factory from stateless agents.
keyMessage: One shared memory across domains.

Adapt: keep nodes-ringing-a-center + the push-IN; four chips (the F4 cast) not a logo cloud; violet rides the hub ring only.
Scene 1 (0.0–3.8s): the four persona chips spring into a ring around the empty center (`orbit-3d-entry` settle, no continuous orbit); hairline connectors draw from each chip to center (`svg-path-draw`).
Scene 2 (3.8–5.5s): on "what one domain learns…", the camera pushes IN toward center (`multi-phase-camera` push leg) as the violet hub ring draws itself and the label "operational context graph" resolves inside.
Scene 3 (5.5–8.6s): the sub-line "topology · change attribution · drift history · incident causality" reveals beneath the hub, mono dim; held read; ring gets subtle jitter at most.

## Selected blueprint: constellation-hub

# constellation-hub — Constellation / Hub + Satellites

**intent**: Labeled/iconned nodes spring into a ring/cluster around a center, then the shot resolves on the core — either by pushing the camera INTO the center (depth-of-field collapsing onto it) or by holding a hub mark while the satellites ORBIT it; the "everything connects to / sits around one center" beat.

**roles served**

- Hook (from `hook-cluster-push-in`): a constellation of tool/app nodes springs into a wide ring, then a sustained camera push-in with depth-of-field resolves on the inner core — "it connects everything / one hub for all your tools."
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-orbit-ecosystem`): the product brand mark lands as the center hub and partner logos spring onto a ring and revolve around it — "plugs into / sits at the center of your stack."
- CTA (from `cta-orbit-collapse`): the ring resolves by COLLAPSE rather than a push-in — category icons drift around an empty central CTA, a cursor click implodes the orbit toward the click point, and the product demo springs OUT of that collapse as the answer (scope → choice → consequence → product).
- Social_Proof (from `proof-logo-chain`): a persistent center logo accrues proofs — its wordmark decodes, a claim ticker swaps, the logo glides to center, then avatars cascade into orbit with drawn connectors while partner logos scroll the bottom strip; four claims read as one statement.
- Social_Proof (from `scatter-drift-finisher`): the ecosystem beat as a
  static END CARD — a two-line serif `[headline]` is the center (no hub mark, no ring), `[~20 app
icons]` pop in scattered frame-wide in a quick stagger, then keep drifting very slowly OUTWARD
  to the end. "Connects to thousands of apps" said with count and spread, not geometry.

**duration**: 5–8s (Hook 5–6s · Social_Proof 5–8s · CTA orbit-collapse ~6s · Social_Proof
scatter-drift end card ~2.5s as a closing beat)

**shot structure**

Consolidated template — nodes ring a center, then one of two finishers resolves on the core.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s): `[bg]` (dark/space field, optionally slow-drifting diffused gradient blobs). `[primary nodes]` (circles carrying `[icon]` + label) SPRING-POP in (scale 0→1, ~1.15 elastic overshoot, staggered) arranged in a wide ring/cluster around an empty or marked center `[hub]`.
- Scene 2 (~0.7–2.5s, overlapping): smaller `[secondary nodes]` (platform / partner-logo chips) pop in staggered with the same elastic spring, filling the gaps; optional thin `[accent]` connector lines / orbit ring draw from hub→nodes. Camera holds.
- Scene 3 (~2.5–Xs, the resolve): see finisher variant below; lands and HOLDS on the magnified / orbited center to the end.

- Variant — Hook (push-in finisher): from Scene 3, a continuous smooth CAMERA PUSH-IN toward the center inner cluster — inner nodes scale up and stay sharp while outer nodes are pushed toward the edges and progressively BLUR (depth-of-field), background scales up smoothly; holds magnified on the core.
- Variant — Social_Proof (orbit finisher): the center `[brand mark]` snaps in via a quick 3D rotate that decelerates and settles; a thin `[accent]` orbit ring draws around it; `[N partner badges]` spring onto the ring (staggered overshoot) and revolve CLOCKWISE while staying upright, under a continuous slow camera ZOOM-OUT (ecosystem reveal).
- Variant — Social_Proof (optional type-push-through opener, prepended before Scene 1): centered `[headline]` types/slides in with a huge transparent-fill OUTLINE copy of the same words behind it; the outline text scales up exponentially toward camera (high-speed dolly / push-through), breaches the frame, then HARD-CUTS to the hub bg of Scene 1.
- Variant — Social_Proof (scatter-drift finisher, no ring): the center is a two-line serif
  `[headline]` building in place (not a mark); `[~20 app icons]` pop in SCATTERED across the whole
  frame in a quick stagger — no ring geometry, no connectors — then sustain a very slow outward
  drift to the end. Camera fully static: no push-in, no zoom-out; the "everything around one
  center" reads from the drift vectors pointing away from the headline. Often chained as the end
  card of a preceding UI beat (the prior card dissolves into it).

**motion vocabulary**: staggered elastic spring-pop node entrances (~1.15 overshoot); slow gradient-blob drift; connector-line / orbit-ring draw-on; 3D snap-rotate-settle on the hub mark; continuous camera push-in (inner sharp, outer depth-of-field blur, bg scale-up); clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges; continuous slow camera zoom-out (ecosystem reveal); optional outline-text push-through dolly entry. Scatter-drift finisher: frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (staggered, no ring); sustained slow
outward icon drift; in-place two-line serif headline build; static-frame hold to the end.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- staggered spring-pop node entrances → `spring-pop-entrance` (elastic overshoot) + `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); 3D-flip-in flavor → `orbit-3d-entry`
- ring / cluster layout of nodes around a center → `avatar-cloud-network` (nodes on an elliptical ring + SVG lines to a center)
- icons on the nodes → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- connector lines hub→node → `svg-path-draw`
- orbit-ring draw-on → `svg-path-draw`
- slow gradient-blob drift → `sine-wave-loop` (idle looped drift)
- 3D snap-rotate-settle on hub mark → `orbit-3d-entry` (3D-flip entry); technique CSS-3D
- clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges → `orbit-3d-entry` (continuous elliptical orbit); technique MotionPath
- camera push-in toward center → `multi-phase-camera` (PUSH-in) + `coordinate-target-zoom` (target the core)
- background scale-up during push-in → `multi-phase-camera`
- continuous slow zoom-out (ecosystem reveal) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) / `coordinate-target-zoom`
- outline-text push-through dolly opener (Social_Proof) → `3d-text-depth-layers` (outline copy behind) + `multi-phase-camera` (push-through)
- depth-of-field blur on outer nodes during push-in → `depth-of-field-blur` (progressive DOF/focus-falloff blur on the off-center outer nodes while the inner core stays sharp)
- frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (no ring) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) +
  `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); positions pre-baked scattered — NOT `avatar-cloud-network`'s
  elliptical ring
- sustained slow outward icon drift → `center-outward-expansion` (outward vectors, slow sustained
  register — drift targets sit slightly past the pop-in positions)
- in-place serif headline build → `gsap-effects` (staggered line/word reveal)

**camera modifier**: push-in-with-DOF (Hook) — `multi-phase-camera` PUSH-in targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` onto the core; the focus-falloff blur half of it is backed by `depth-of-field-blur`. Orbit finisher (Social_Proof) — slow continuous zoom-out via `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) while satellites revolve. Scatter-drift finisher (Social_Proof end card) — none: the frame never moves; the outward drift
is element-level.

# Multi-Phase Camera

A camera wrapper around the ENTIRE scene that progresses through discrete zoom phases at scripted triggers, with continuous sine-driven micro-drift overlaid so the camera never feels static between phases. Distinct from a single linear zoom — multi-phase creates cinematic pacing (anticipation → reveal → settle).

## How It Works

The camera is one wrapping `<div>` whose `transform: scale() translate(x, y)` is composed from two channels inside a single `onUpdate` writer:

1. **Phase scale** — a proxy object `{ scale }` stepped through phases at trigger times (`PHASE_1_SCALE` at t=0 → `PHASE_2_SCALE` at `PHASE_2_AT` → `PHASE_3_SCALE` at `PHASE_3_AT`).
2. **Drift offset** — a continuous sine-based `translateX` / `translateY` (small amplitude, slow frequency) ADDED to the phase transform. X and Y run at slightly different frequencies (`DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO ≈ 1.3`) — equal frequencies produce a perfect diagonal that reads mechanical; ~1.3 gives an organic Lissajous.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="camera" id="camera">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="hero">{Brand}</div>
    <div class="tagline">{tagline}</div>
    <div class="cta">{ctaText}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any phase scale < 1 exposes the content's edges */
  background: {sceneBgColor}; /* background on .scene, NOT .camera — a camera-borne
     background warps/translates with the transform and reveals the outer void */
}
.camera {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* off-center origin creates phase-to-phase drift */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
const camera = document.getElementById("camera");

// Three-phase scale plan: pullback → focus → push.
const phase = { scale: PHASE_1_SCALE }; // Phase 1 is the initial value — no tween

// Phase 2 — settle to neutral focus
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_2_SCALE, duration: PHASE_2_DUR, ease: PHASE_2_EASE }, PHASE_2_AT);

// Phase 3 — slow push-in for the climax
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_3_SCALE, duration: PHASE_3_DUR, ease: PHASE_3_EASE }, PHASE_3_AT);

// Drift driver — continuous sine motion overlaid on the phase scale.
// The ONE writer of camera.style.transform.
const drift = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  drift,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * DRIFT_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION, // spans the whole composition
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const dx = Math.sin(drift.p) * DRIFT_AMP_X;
      const dy = Math.sin(drift.p * DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO) * DRIFT_AMP_Y;
      camera.style.transform = `scale(${phase.scale}) translate(${dx}px, ${dy}px)`;
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Content reveals happen INSIDE the camera frame (hero/tagline/cta beats).
```

## Phase Patterns

| Pattern             | Scale sequence (1 → 2 → 3)        | Feel                            | When to use                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Focus-in**        | back → neutral → slight push      | Approach → settle → slight push | Default product reveal        |
| **Dramatic reveal** | push → neutral → pull             | Wide → focus → settle back      | Hero shot with breathing room |
| **Steady push**     | neutral → slight push → more push | Gradual forward momentum        | Continuous narrative push     |
| **Bookend pull**    | neutral → strong push → neutral   | Settle → push → release         | CTA emphasis then release     |

## Variations

- **Phase trigger by content beat**: align a camera tween's start with a content tween's end (entry completes → push begins) rather than a fixed clock value.
- **Camera shake (panic / impact)**: a brief higher-amplitude, higher-frequency drift tween over a short window — same `drift` mechanism with `SHAKE_AMP` / `SHAKE_CYCLES` / `SHAKE_DUR` at `SHAKE_AT`.
- **Targeted zoom into an off-center element**: combine scale with counter-translation so the target lands at viewport center — divide the measured offset by the current scale before feeding it into the writer:

```js
const tRect = document.querySelector(".cta").getBoundingClientRect();
const offsetX = (STAGE_W / 2 - (tRect.left + tRect.width / 2)) / phase.scale;
const offsetY = (STAGE_H / 2 - (tRect.top + tRect.height / 2)) / phase.scale;
// then in onUpdate: translate(offsetX + dx, offsetY + dy)
```

| HERO_AT (etc.)              | after Phase-2 settle lands               | a hero fading in mid-pull-back feels like it's flying away                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **Camera wraps EVERYTHING in the scene** — a per-element camera creates parallax bugs and breaks the "one viewpoint" read.
- **One writer**: phase scale and drift compose inside the single drift `onUpdate`; nothing else touches `camera.style.transform`.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`** — required whenever any phase scale < 1.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.camera`** — off-center origin creates unpredictable phase-to-phase drift.
- **Scene background on `.scene`, not `.camera`** — otherwise scaling/translating reveals the outer void.
- **Hero reveal starts AFTER the initial pull-back ease lands** — otherwise the headline feels like it's flying away.

# Orbit with 3D Entry

Elements flip in from 3D space (`rotateX` + `rotateY` + negative `z`) then settle into a continuous elliptical orbit around a center label. Distinct from one-shot reveals — the orbit keeps running, driven by a 0→1 progress tween INSIDE the timeline (never rAF).

## How It Works

Per element, two phases: (1) a `back.out` flip from a hidden 3D orientation to flat — **in place at its orbital starting position** (see Critical Constraints); (2) a continuous orbit where `onUpdate` computes `x/y` from `cos/sin(initialAngle + p·2π)` on the ellipse. The stage needs `perspective` on the scene root and `preserve-3d` on stage + items, or the flip flattens to a 2D scale.

## Recipe

  <!-- … evenly-spaced angles … -->
  <div class="orbit-center">{centerLabel}</div>
</div>
```

.scene-root {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;

}
.orbit-stage {

}
.orbit-center {
  position: relative;
  transform: translateZ(220px); /* wins paint order inside preserve-3d */
  z-index: 9999;
}
```

```js
const items = document.querySelectorAll(".orbit-item");
const RADIUS_Y = RADIUS_X * Y_TO_X_RATIO; // perspective-flattened ellipse

items.forEach((el, i) => {
  const a0 = (Number(el.dataset.angle) / 360) * Math.PI * 2;
  const startX = Math.cos(a0) * RADIUS_X;
  const startY = Math.sin(a0) * RADIUS_Y;

  // 1) Park at the orbital position, hidden — BEFORE any tween fires
  gsap.set(el, {
    xPercent: -50,

    x: startX,
    y: startY,

    opacity: 0,

  });

  // 2) Flip in IN PLACE — rotation/opacity/scale only, never translate
  tl.to(
    el,
    {
      rotateX: 0,
      rotateY: 0,
      z: 0,
      opacity: 1,
      scale: 1,
      duration: ENTRY_DUR,
      ease: `back.out(${FLIP_BACK})`,
    },
    i * STAGGER,
  );

  // 3) Continuous orbit — each item gets its OWN progress tween (own initialAngle)
  const orbit = { p: 0 };
  tl.to(
    orbit,
    {
      p: 1,
      duration: ORBIT_DURATION,
      ease: "none",
      onUpdate: () => {
        const a = a0 + orbit.p * Math.PI * 2;
        const x = Math.cos(a) * RADIUS_X;
        const y = Math.sin(a) * RADIUS_Y;
        // capped z-index band [1, 50] — see center-label clearance below
        el.style.zIndex = String(1 + Math.round(((y + RADIUS_Y) / (2 * RADIUS_Y)) * 49));
        el.style.transform = `translate(-50%, -50%) translate(${x}px, ${y}px)`;
      },
    },
    i * STAGGER + ENTRY_DUR,
  );
});

tl.from(
  ".orbit-center",
  { opacity: 0, scale: 0.6, duration: ENTRY_DUR, ease: `back.out(${CENTER_BACK})` },
  CENTER_FADE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Collapse to center**: a final 1→0 driver multiplies both radii (and item scale) in `onUpdate` — the ring condenses into the center element; pairs with a CTA "click" igniting the collapse.
- **Tilted orbit plane**: `rotateX(25deg)` on `.orbit-stage` — items visibly arc through the plane.

## Critical Constraints

- **❗ Entry must flip IN PLACE at the orbital position, NOT at center** — `gsap.set` each item at `(cos(a0)·RADIUS_X, sin(a0)·RADIUS_Y)` with `opacity: 0` BEFORE adding tweens, then phase 1 animates only rotation/opacity/scale. A fromTo that keeps `x/y: 0` flips at the stage center, collides with the center label, then teleports to the orbit when phase 2 starts.
- **❗ Center-label clearance** — `z-index` alone is unreliable inside `preserve-3d` (paint order follows actual Z): push the label forward with `translateZ(220px)` + `z-index: 9999`, cap item z-index to `[1, 50]`, AND size the ring so items clear the label horizontally at every angle: `RADIUS_X × min|cos(θ)| ≥ L_w + I_w + breathing_room` (label/item half-widths; for 6 items the worst case is `cos(30°) ≈ 0.866`). A heavier wordmark needs a wider ring.
- **Each item gets its OWN orbit tween** — a shared `targets: ".orbit-item"` tween can't carry per-item `initialAngle`.
- **The center element is the headline** — the orbit is ornament; if it dominates, grow the center or fade the items down.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
